# Xanthia
![Screenshot 1](/screenshots/1.gif)

Xanthia is a notification system for MacOS that uses Ubersicht.  By default it is styled to match MacOS' default appearance.  If you have `Pecan` installed then it will pull style from that instead.

Here is without `Pecan`:

And here is with:

## Instructions

Xanthia requires [Übersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/).  Once Übersicht is installed, you can clone this repository to where your Übersicht bars are placed.

```
git clone https://github.com/zzzeyez/Xanthia.git $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Übersicht/widgets/Xanthia
```

Xanthia includes a script to make notifications appear.  Until you use this script, you will receive an error.

Use the included `notify-send` like so:

```
./notify-send "New message"
```

So, assuming `notify-send` is in your path, you can enter this into `Weechat` for notifications:

```
/set trigger.trigger.beep.command "/exec -norc notify-send '${tg_tag_nick}: ${tg_message_nocolor}'"
```

#### Wal

Xanthia can pull a color palette generated by Wal using Sassc.  I have included a script, `wal-set`, that will perform this.
 
To install Sassc:

```
brew install sassc
```
  
And then you must change the username at the top of `scss/style.scss` to that of your own:

```
sed -i -e "s/zzzeyez/$USER/g" ~/Library/Application\ Support/Übersicht/widgets/Xanthia/scss/style.scss
```
  
Now you can run the script to use Wal's palettes:

```
bash ~/Library/Application\ Support/Übersicht/widgets/Pecan/wal-set
```
